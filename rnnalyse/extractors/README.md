# Activation extraction

This folder contains several classes that help to extract activations from different pytorch language models.

TODO:
- implement these classes (can be copied from what we already had)
- explain in this README how this is implemented
- explain how it can be used (including what is the output format) 
- write down potential other ones that could be implemented (such as GRU?)
